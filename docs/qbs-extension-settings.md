# Configure extension settings

Qbs tools supports a variety of settings that can be set at
the user, or workspace, level via VSCode's `settings.json` file.

This topic covers the available options and how they are used.

Options that support substitution, in the table below, allow
variable references to appear in their strings.

See [variable substitution](#variable-substitution), below,
for more information about variable expansion.

## Settings

| Setting | Description | Default value | Supports substitution |
|---------|---------|---------|-----|
| `qbs.autoResolve` | Starts the automatic resolution of the project when changes are made to the build files. | `true` | No. |

| `qbs.installAfterBuild` | Installs the products after building. | `true` | No. |
| `qbs.keepGoing` | Keeps [going](https://doc.qt.io/qbs/cli-build.html#op-op-op-op-keep-op-op-going-op-op-op-op-k) when errors occur, if at all possible. | `false` | No. |
| `qbs.launchFilePath` | Specify location to the debugger configuration in the `launch.json` file. | `${sourceDirectory}/.vscode/launch.json` | Yes. |
| `qbs.logLevel` | Uses the specified [log level](https://doc.qt.io/qbs/cli-build.html#op-op-op-op-log-op-op-level-op-lt-op-level-op-gt-op). | `info` | No. |
| `qbs.maxBuildJobs` | Specify the number of CPU cores to build. | `0` (Causes Qbs to use all CPU cores.) | No. |

| `qbs.saveBeforeBuild` | Saves open files before building (applicable for Resolve, Build, and ReBuild operations). | `true` | No. |
| `qbs.settingsDirectory` | Specify location of the Qbs [settings directory](https://doc.qt.io/qbs/cli-config.html#op-op-op-op-settings-op-op-dir-op-lt-op-directory-op-gt-op). | `` (An empty value forces the use of the default path.) | Yes. |
| `qbs.showDisabledProjectItems` | Shows the disabled project items (sub-projects, products, groups). | `false` | No. |

## Variable substitution

Some options support the replacement of special values in
their string value by using a `${variable}` syntax.

The following built-in variables are expanded:

| Variable | Expansion |
|---------|---------|
| `${configurationName}` | The current Qbs build configuration name. For example: `debug`, `release`. |
| `${profileName}` | The current Qbs build profile name. For example: `MSVC2019-x86`, `clang-cl-x86`. |
| `${projectName}` | The current project name. |
| `${sourceDirectory}` | The full path to the workspace root directory. |

### Command substitution

Qbs tools can expand VS Code commands. For example, you can expand the path to the build
directory or the target executable path of the selected product by using the syntax
`${command:qbs.getProductBuildDirectory}` or `${command:qbs.getProductExecutablePath}`.

Be careful with long-running commands because it isn't specified when, or how many times,
Qbs tools will execute a command fora given expansion.

Supported commands for substitution:

| Command | Substitution |
|-------|------------|
| `qbs.getProductBuildDirectory` | The full path to the build directory of the selected product. |
| `qbs.getProductExecutablePath` | The full path to target executable of the selected product. |
