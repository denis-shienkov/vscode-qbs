* Run the `qbs config --list profiles` to make sure
that the profiles are successfully configured.

## Open a project

* From the command palette in VS Code, run the **File: Open Folder**

## Set up include paths for C++ IntelliSense

Qbs currently supports Microsoft's `ms-vscode.cpptools`
extension. If this extension is installed and enabled, then
configuring your project will provide this integration
automatically.

The `ms-vscode.cpptools` will show a prompt confirming that
you wish to use Qbs to provide the configuration information
for your project. Accept this prompt to activate the integration.
Subsequently, Qbs will provide and automatically update cpptools
configuration information for each source file in your project.
