# How to Contribute to QBS

This article is for developers who want to contribute to the QBS open source project.

## Build the QBS extension

As with most VS Code extensions, you'll need [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
We use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) to compile the code.

The process is:

1. Open the repo in VS Code

2. Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to build and run the extension

## Coding guidelines

### Formatting

Code is formatted using `clang-format`. We recommend you install the
[Clang-Format extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xaver.clang-format).
